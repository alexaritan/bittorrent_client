HELLO RANDOM PERSON!

I began building this Bittorrent client as an independent study project during my senior year at college in order to learn both the Bittorrent protocol and the Ruby language.  Now, I'm just working on it in my spare time as a fun side project.  Eventually, it will undoubtedly become the best, most popular (single-threaded) Bittorrent client (without a UI) in human history!

That is all.
